Setting:
~12k instances, ~300 attributes, 1k trees, no max depth.

Runtime:
-SKlearn: ~30s, trees ~30-40 deep.
-CeDAR: ~7min (originally 30min), trees about 15-25 deep.
  * Stricter filtering of attributes reduced time by ~2.4x.
  * Only searching for the left half indices reduced time further by ~1.75x.
  * Removing Gini index computation takes ~1s off the time.
  * Removing metadata is negligible.
  * Switching to an iterative approach is negligible.
  * Biggest contributing factor: max depth.
  * Simply compiling cedar.py with Cython gives a speedup of ~1.3x.
  * Writing build code in Cython?
