Exact Adversary:
-Pick best two attributes.
-Delete instances until one passes the other.
-Repeat.

Certified Adversary:
-Pick best attribute.
-Increase probability of this attribute until the
 indistinguishability threshold is reached.
-Repeat.

Problem
-------
-One can take the gradient of the ratio: G(xi) / sum_j G(x_j),
 but this only tells you which val, label pair maximizes this
 expression.
-We need a single instance with ONE label, so a thorough search
 still needs to be done to find an instance, which will likely
 not be the pairs with the largest gradient values.
-We probably don't even need to compute the gradient to tell
 which pairs will maximize the expression; we can probably
 just brute force that part for each attribute.

Question
--------
-Should we pick a random attribute, best attribute, or search over
 multiple attributes when maximizing the above expression?
